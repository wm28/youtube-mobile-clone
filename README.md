# youtube-mobile-clone
A web clone of the YouTube android mobile UI for learning purposes.

[LIVE DEMO](https://wm28.github.io/youtube-mobile-clone/)

This project is inspired and adapted by the talk given by [mobile first animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laPsceJ4tTY) talk at React Conf 2019, which was given by Alexandra Holachek. The demo repo can be found [here](https://github.com/aholachek/mobile-first-animation).

This react app uses `react-spring` and `react-use-gesture` to recreate native mobile animations that I don't usually encounter on the web. I adapted and build upon the above repo to recreate complex miniplayer animations found on the youtube mobile app.
