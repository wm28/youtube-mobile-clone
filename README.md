This project is inspired by the [mobile first animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laPsceJ4tTY) talk at React Conf 2019, which was given by Alexandra Holachek. The demo for the talk can be found [here](https://github.com/aholachek/mobile-first-animation).

This react app uses `react-spring` and `react-use-gesture` to recreate native mobile animations. I adapted and build upon the above repo to recreate complex miniplayer animations that are found on the youtube mobile app.
